### Binary Tree

- If the node has maximum two children, it's called Binary Tree.
- Databases uses Tree's for indexing. Autocompletion also uses Binary Search Tree to quickly lookup data.
- Binary Search Tree has logarithmic time complexity. Whenever we throw half of the values in each step, it is
  logarithmic (O(logn)). So:
- Lookup = O(logn)
- Insert = O(logn)
- Delete = O(logn)

- That's why Binary Search Tree performs better than Linear Data Structures. But, if the tree is not structured
  properly, it might degrade the performance.
